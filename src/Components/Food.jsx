              Our culinary ethos blends innovation, live fire cooking, umami, and an array of exotic spices. Infused with our founder Aji Akokomiâ€™s
              West African heritage, our dedicated team of chefs expertly craft a diverse range of dishes, honouring tradition while pushing the boundaries of culinary creativity. 
              We blend the freshest seasonal British ingredients with African spices, resulting in a dining
              experience that is both culturally resonant and distinctly exceptional.
